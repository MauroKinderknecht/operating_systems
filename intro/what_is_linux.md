# What is a kernel?

A kernel is a computer program at the core od a computer's operating system and
generally has complete control over everything in the system. It is the portion
of the operating system core that is always resident in memory and facilitates 
interaction between hardware and software components.

A full kernel controls all hardware resources (I/O, memory, cryptography) via 
device drivers, arbitrates conflicts between processes concerning such 
resources and optimizes the utilization of common resources (CPU, cache, file
systems, network)
